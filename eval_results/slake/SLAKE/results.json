But the question asks for \"diseases included in the picture,\" which is vague. The image itself doesn't show a specific disease but rather a potential abnormality. Given the options, the most likely answer would be a condition that affects the lungs, such as pneumonia or lung cancer, but the image alone isn't diagnostic.

The image is a standard chest X-ray, which is usually taken in the coronal plane. However, the options might be different. Wait, the question is about the scanning plane. Let's think: the image is a chest X-ray, which is a 2D projection. The scanning plane for a chest X-ray is typically the coronal plane (frontal view). But let's check the options. Wait, the question is asking for the scanning plane. In medical imaging, the coronal plane is a vertical plane that divides the body into anterior and posterior parts.

However, the question might be expecting a specific count. Let's re-evaluate. The heart is one organ, the lungs are two (left and right), so that's three. But sometimes in medical imaging, the lungs are considered as one organ (respiratory system). Wait, the question says \"organs\" (plural), so we need to count distinct organs. The heart is one, the lungs are two (left and right), so total three. Let's check the image again. The heart is in the center, the lungs are on either side.
